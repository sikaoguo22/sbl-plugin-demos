# sbl-plugin-demos
This repository contains a Pixi-based project that sets up all dependencies needed to experiment with the Structural Bioinformatics Library (SBL) and its plugins in a fully reproducible way. It provides:​
- A Pixi manifest (pixi.toml) describing the environment, including JupyterLab, pixi-kernel, SBL runtime dependencies.​
- Simple installation instructions to install SBL following the official installation guide.​
- A set of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to run SBL plugins on different molecular viewer (VMD, PyMOL, NGL viewer in Web).​
- The goal is to serve as an shareable demo for new users, collaborators, and reviewers to quickly test SBL plugins without manual environment debugging.
